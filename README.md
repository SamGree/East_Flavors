## Design Philosophy
- User-Centered Design:
  - The design emphasizes ease of navigation, ensuring users can quickly find what they need, such as menu options, table bookings, or location information. With clear sections like "Welcome to East Flavors" and "Find Your Best Food," users are guided seamlessly through the content.

- Visual Appeal and Authenticity:
  - The homepage uses high-quality images of food that capture the essence of Middle Eastern cuisine. This visual appeal is key to making users feel connected to the experience, as the design reflects the vibrancy and diversity of the dishes.
- Minimalistic Yet Informative:
  - The layout is simple yet informative, with clean sections and minimal text, allowing the food and visuals to speak for themselves. This minimalism ensures that users are not overwhelmed but can still access all necessary information, such as contact details, opening hours, and the booking system.      
- Color Palette.
  - Primary Colors:(#061918) Used for the header and footer. 
  - White (#FFFFFF): Applied for text and backgrounds to enhance readability and contrast against the darker elements.
  - Red (#FF0000): Used as an accent color for the navigation links to indicate the active page.
  - Body Background Colors: var(--color-grey-0).
  - Background color of the dish descriptions: var(--color-red-100) this soft and warm tone makes the text readable and adds a light.
  - Text Color black: used in the meals detailed descriptions and prices to maintain simplicity and clarity.
- Typography.
  - The typography for the East Flavors website is chosen to enhance readability, create a professional look, and align with the brand's modern and elegant feel. It is designed to ensure that the content is clear and accessible to all users while maintaining a cohesive visual identity.
- Design Process.
  - The design process for the East Flavors website was an iterative journey focused on creating a user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional restaurant website. As the sole designer, I managed all aspects of the design, from conceptualization to the final product, ensuring consistency and alignment with the restaurant’s brand.    
  - Research & Inspiration:
    - I began by researching modern restaurant websites, focusing on usability, aesthetics, and how food imagery can influence user engagement. Inspiration was drawn from both local and international restaurant brands to identify best practices in web design, user interface, and user experience.
  - Branding & Visual Identity:
    - Establishing a strong visual identity for East Flavors was a priority. I worked on creating a logo that reflects the restaurant’s Middle Eastern heritage with a modern twist. The color palette, fonts, and imagery were chosen to reflect warmth, authenticity, and a high-quality dining experience.
  - Responsive Design:
    - Recognizing that many users would access the website from mobile devices, I prioritized responsive design from the start. I ensured that all layouts would adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, making the experience equally rich and engaging on mobile, tablet, and desktop. 
  - Wireframing & Layout Design:
    - Using wireframes, I sketched out the layout for each page, focusing on simplicity and ease of navigation. The homepage was designed to feature stunning food photography and an immediate call to action (menu exploration and booking a table).
  - Finalization & Launch:
    - The final design of East Flavors reflects a welcoming, vibrant, and user-friendly experience. Each element, from the color palette to typography and imagery, was thoughtfully crafted to engage users while showcasing the restaurant’s offerings and simplifying the online booking process.

## Bugs.
 -  Duplicate ID Errors: 
    - Issue: I received multiple errors for duplicate id attributes in HTML elements (e.g., menu-image, text, title, etc.).
    - Cause: IDs in HTML must be unique within a page. Having duplicate IDs can cause conflicts, especially with JavaScript and styling.
    - Fix: Updated elements to use unique IDs or used class attributes instead of id where applicable. 
 - Image Accessibility Issues:
    - Issue: Some images were missing alt attributes, leading to warnings about accessibility.
    - Fix: Added descriptive alt attributes to all images to ensure better accessibility and SEO.
 - Time Validation for Booking:
    - Issue: When users tried to book a table before the restaurant's opening hours (e.g., 9:00 AM), they received a validation error.
    - Cause: The restaurant operates between 11:00 AM and 11:00 PM, and the booking form wasn't validating the time range correctly.
    - Fix: Implemented proper time validation to ensure users can only select a time within operating hours.
 - CSS Validator Errors:
    - Issue: CSS validation produced errors due to incorrect usage of certain properties, like justify-content: baseline.
    - Fix: Updated CSS to use the correct properties (e.g., justify-content: center).
 - Test Failures Due to Incorrect String Representation:
    - Issue: One of my tests failed because the __str__ method in my Menu model was returning the wrong string ("Menu object (1)" instead of "Spaghetti").
    - Cause: The __str__ method was incorrectly defined outside the class.
    - Fix: Moved the __str__ method inside the Menu class so it correctly returns the name of the menu item.
 - User Could Book a Table in the Past:
    - Issue: Initially, users were able to book tables for times in the past, which was not allowed and created incorrect data in the booking system.   
    - Fix: A solution was implemented to prevent users from booking tables in the past by handling timezones and validating booking times:
      - Installed the pytz library for timezone handling.
      - utils.py: Updated to check if the booking time is in the future based on the user's timezone.
      - views.py: Modified to receive the user's timezone from the frontend and validate the booking time.
      - main.js: Added JavaScript to capture the user's timezone.
- unsolved bugs:
  - none.
